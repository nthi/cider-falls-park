// 	Function: 
//I think I need two functions? One to find the services for a particular park area and one to take that information through a loop to create the html for each particular park areaâ€™s services.
//getting cities in deshawns similarity
//look at Walkers.js
//define function that will create an --htmlstring-- of services for each park area?
//first iterate through park areas. NEED AREA ID
//In each park area, iterate through serviceAreaBridge. 
//if the service area bridge object has the same id as the park area, push the service to that park's --htmlstring--.
//use the right <></>s when adding the html into the correct park area?

//Area ID > search bridge table > collect service id, get service obj
